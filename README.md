## obscene-fish
Make the Fish shell a bit more... offensive. Fits perfectly along [obscene-sudo](https://github.com/perfaram/obscene-sudo).

### Situation
Currently, only insults you in case of a "command not found". I'm planning on adding more (PR welcome !).
Insults come mostly from Sudo's insult list (Goon show, HAL9000, CSOps), but I added a few more (including quotes from Games of Thrones !!).

### Installation
Just copy-paste the function into your `config.fish` file.

###### Have fun.
